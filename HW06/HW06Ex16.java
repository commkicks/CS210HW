// CS210 Fall2019 Assignment: HW06 Ex 16 "mostCommonNames"

// 27/OCT/2019
// Write a method called mostCommonNames that accepts a Scanner representing an input file with names on each line separated by spaces. 
// Some names appear multiple times in a row on the same line. For each line, print the most commonly occurring name. 
// If thereâ€™s a tie, use the first name that had that many occurrences; if all names are unique, print the first name on the line.
